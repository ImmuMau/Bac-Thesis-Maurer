Antenna Measurement via Near- to Far-field Transformation

This Github repository was created as part of the bachelor thesis "Antenna Measurement via Near- to Far-Field Transformation" for sharing the thesis and its code.
The code includes the derivation of far-field-patterns from a planar measurmentes of directive antennas and everything that is needed for their comparison to a spherical state-of-the-art-measurement.

I did everything to the best of my knowledge at that time. This code is not actively maintained after submitting the bachelor thesis.
